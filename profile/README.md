# Pairup

## Overview

Pairup is a platform where users can collaborate based on their complementary skills, with the understanding that any profits generated from their joint efforts will be shared. It provides an opportunity for individuals with different skill sets to work together towards a common goal, leveraging their respective strengths to potentially create something profitable. Even if the project doesn't yield profits, it still serves as valuable experience and a portfolio piece for both parties involved.
